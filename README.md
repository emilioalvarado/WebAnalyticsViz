# WebAnalyticsViz
The main objective of the 'Web Analytics Visualization' project is to increase the client's analysis capabilities about its user's browsing behavior on the company's website. For this, a visual analytics solution is proposed in order to solve three main tasks: to present the distribution of the pages visited by the users in a given period of time, to discover characteristics of interest - as the quantity of users with similar navigation behaviour per session or the different routes and sales funnels that were found; and finally compare the behavior of sales funnels of site visitors without a previously established goal.
